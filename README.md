# workshop task
i was excited to do this one becuase i love clicking buttons.... i considered doing a birthday party invite, or an interactive forest but i chose something simpler instead for my first attempt - will probably save these ideas for exquisite corpse. de

decided on a sketch where the user can choose and name their own horse (using more random pictures from my computer.

3 parts - selecting horse, confirming horse and naming horse. it was challenging to make sure that these parts were sepearate because i have trouble figuring out which line of code is going to effect which part (i was somewhat successful this time)

once you typ in the name of the horse it will be displayed on the screen and follow your mouse - once youve chosen your horse you cant go back and choose another one (that would be cruel) so you have to refresh the sketch.

was able to pretty much grasp most interactive tools.
